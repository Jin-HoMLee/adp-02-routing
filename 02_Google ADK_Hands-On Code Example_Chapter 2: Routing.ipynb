    "The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a framework for engineering agentic systems, providing a structured environment for defining an agent's capabilities and behaviours. In contrast to architectures based on explicit computational graphs, routing within the ADK paradigm is typically implemented by defining a discrete set of \"tools\" that represent the agent's functions. The selection of the appropriate tool in response to a user query is managed by the framework's internal logic, which leverages an underlying model to match user intent to the correct functional handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python code demonstrates an example of an Agent Development Kit (ADK) application using Google's ADK library. It sets up a \"Coordinator\" agent that routes user requests to specialized sub-agents (\"Booker\" for bookings and \"Info\" for general information) based on defined instructions. The sub-agents then use specific tools to simulate handling the requests, showcasing a basic delegation pattern within an agent system. \n"
